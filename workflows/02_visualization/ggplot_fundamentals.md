# Vibe Workflow: ggplot2 Fundamentals for Ecological Data

**Goal:** Master the essential ggplot2 patterns for creating clear, informative, and publication-ready ecological visualizations.

**Vibe:** Building beautiful plots is storytelling with data. Every aesthetic choice should serve the narrative and help your audience understand the ecological patterns you've discovered.

**Core Packages:** `tidyverse`, `viridis`, `ggrepel`, `patchwork`

## ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check

This workflow teaches the grammar of graphics through ecological examples. We'll explore how to layer aesthetic mappings, geometries, and themes to create compelling visualizations that communicate ecological insights effectively. Each plot type serves a specific purpose in ecological analysis.

```english
Load essential libraries for ecological visualization:
- Load tidyverse for comprehensive data manipulation and ggplot2
- Load viridis for colorblind-friendly color palettes
- Load ggrepel for non-overlapping text labels in crowded plots
- Load patchwork for combining multiple plots into publication figures
- Load scales for professional axis formatting and label control
- Load here for robust relative file paths across systems

Establish reproducible visualization environment:
- Set random seed to 123 for consistent jittering and sampling
- Create output directory structure for figures if it doesn't exist
- Create output directory structure for tables if it doesn't exist
- Verify workspace is organized for systematic plot development
```

## ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up

We'll use multiple datasets to demonstrate different visualization approaches. The iris dataset provides continuous variables for regression plots, while our custom ecological data shows discrete patterns. We prepare the data to highlight specific visualization principles.

```english
Prepare demonstration datasets:
- Load built-in iris dataset for continuous variable examples
- Load mtcars dataset for additional regression demonstrations
- Verify these datasets have appropriate structure for visualization examples

Create custom ecological demonstration dataset:
- Generate site identifiers with zero-padded numbering (Site_01, Site_02, etc.)
- Define habitat categories reflecting realistic ecological gradients
- Include four common species across different habitats
- Create abundance data that shows realistic species-habitat associations
- Add environmental variables (elevation, soil pH) with ecological realism
- Ensure data structure supports multiple visualization approaches

Generate summary statistics for visualization:
- Group data by habitat and species combinations
- Calculate mean abundance and standard error for error bar plots
- Count number of sites per group for statistical validity
- Create habitat-level summaries for categorical comparisons

Compute site-level diversity metrics:
- Group data by site with environmental characteristics
- Calculate species richness (count of species present)
- Compute total abundance across all species per site
- Calculate Shannon diversity index using standard ecological formula
- Prepare data structure for multidimensional scatter plots

## ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions

Before jumping into visualization, we explore our data to understand the patterns we want to highlight. Each plot type serves a specific analytical purpose - from showing distributions to revealing relationships to comparing groups. Understanding your data structure guides visualization choices.

```english
Develop habitat pattern summaries:
- Group data by habitat type across all sites
- Calculate mean species richness and total abundance per habitat
- Determine dominant species in each habitat based on abundance
- Sort habitats by mean species richness for visualization prioritization

Develop environmental correlation summaries:
- Compute pairwise correlations between environmental variables
- Round correlation coefficients to three decimal places for readability
- Display correlation matrix to identify key relationships

Develop species-specific pattern summaries:
- Group data by individual species across all sites
- Calculate total abundance summed across all occurrences
- Count number of sites where each species is present
- Determine mean elevation where species occurs (excluding absences)
- Identify preferred habitat using frequency of occurrence
- Sort species by total abundance for visualization prioritization

Conduct data inspection and validation:
- Check dimensions of all prepared datasets
- Verify species data contains expected number of observations
- Confirm habitat summary has appropriate grouping structure
- Validate site diversity calculations cover all sites
- Display species patterns to verify ecological realism
- Ensure data is ready for comprehensive visualization workflow
```
