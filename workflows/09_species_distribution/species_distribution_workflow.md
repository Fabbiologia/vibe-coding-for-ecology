# Vibe Workflow: Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)

**Goal:** Implement SDM algorithms with cross-validation and generate habitat suitability maps.

**Vibe:** Merging ecology with machine learning to predict species distributions.

**Core Packages:** `SDMtune`, `dismo`, `blockCV`, `raster`

## ðŸª´ Project Setup  ï¿¼ Vibe Check

Setup necessary packages and environments for species distribution modeling.

> **Cursor AI Prompt:**
> 
> Write R code to:
> - Load the following libraries: SDMtune, dismo, blockCV, raster, tidyverse.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Acquisition  ï¿¼ Preparation

Acquire and prepare environmental predictors and species occurrence data for SDM.

> **Cursor AI Prompt:**
> 
> Write R code to:
> - Acquire or load environmental predictor rasters and species occurrence data suitable for SDM.
> - Prepare and clean the data for modeling (e.g., check for missing values, align rasters, format occurrence data).

## ðŸ”¬ SDM Algorithm Implementation

Implement species distribution models using maxent and other algorithms.

> **Cursor AI Prompt:**
> 
> Write R code to:
> - Implement a species distribution model using Maxent (or another algorithm) with the prepared data.
> - Summarize and print model performance metrics.

## ðŸ”„ Cross-Validation Techniques

Apply cross-validation techniques to assess model performance.

> **Cursor AI Prompt:**
> 
> Write R code to:
> - Apply spatial block cross-validation (using blockCV) to the SDM.
> - Evaluate and print cross-validation results and model performance.

## ðŸ“Š Habitat Suitability Map Generation

Generate maps for habitat suitability predictions across landscapes.

> **Cursor AI Prompt:**
> 
> Write R code to:
> - Generate and plot habitat suitability maps from the SDM predictions.
> - Save the maps as high-resolution images.
