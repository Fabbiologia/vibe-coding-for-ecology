# Vibe Workflow: Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)

**Goal:** Implement SDM algorithms with cross-validation and generate habitat suitability maps.

**Vibe:** Merging ecology with machine learning to predict species distributions.

**Core Packages:** `SDMtune`, `dismo`, `blockCV`, `raster`

---

## ðŸª´ Project Setup  Vibe Check
