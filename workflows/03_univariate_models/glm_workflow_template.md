**Goal:** Master the art of fitting GLMs for ecological data, from selecting appropriate error structures to validating assumptions and interpreting results in biological context.

**Vibe:** GLMs are the Swiss Army knife of ecological statistics. They handle the messy reality of ecological data - counts, proportions, and non-normal distributions - while maintaining the interpretable framework of linear modeling. Every model tells a story about ecological processes.

**Core Packages:** `tidyverse`, `broom`, `performance`, `DHARMa`, `car`, `emmeans`

## ü™¥ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check

GLMs extend linear regression to handle non-normal response variables common in ecology. This workflow teaches you to think about the biological process generating your data and choose appropriate error structures. We'll cover the three most common GLM families in ecology: Poisson (counts), binomial (proportions), and Gamma (continuous positive values).

### **Essential Library Configuration**

## üßπ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up

GLM success depends on understanding your data structure and the biological process it represents. We'll examine different response variable types and their appropriate transformations. Unlike linear regression, GLMs can handle count data, proportions, and skewed distributions naturally through link functions.

### **Data Structure Assessment**

```

### **Response Variable Characterization**

```english

- Assess variance-to-mean ratio for count data (overdispersion indication)
- Plot response against key predictors to identify relationships
- Document expected biological patterns based on ecological theory
```

### **Predictor Variable Preparation**

```english
