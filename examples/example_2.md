Objective: Generate a portfolio of ready-to-use, "vibe coding" workflow examples for common ecological analyses. Each workflow must be a self-contained, well-documented markdown file (.md). These will serve as a definitive, open-source reference for a manuscript and a public code repository, aimed at ecologists.

Part 1: The Core Philosophy - "Vibe Coding"
Before generating the workflows, you must internalize the "Vibe Coding" philosophy. It is a human-centric approach to computational analysis that prioritizes clarity, reproducibility, and intuition over terse, machine-optimized code. The "vibe" is a feeling of rightness and ease a researcher gets when they can understand and trust an entire analysis pipeline at a glance.

The Four Pillars of Vibe Coding:

Narrative-Driven Structure: The code is structured like a story. Each script and section has a clear purpose that contributes to the overall analytical narrative. Use comments to explain the why, not just the what.

Sanctuary of Scripts: The project directory is clean and predictable. Raw data is sacred and never modified directly. Scripts are numbered sequentially to show the flow of work. Outputs are tidy and systematically named.

Clarity is King: Use descriptive variable names (e.g., species_richness_model instead of m1). Use pipes (|>) and tools like the tidyverse to make data manipulation readable as a series of steps. The code should feel intuitive and easy to follow for someone new to the project.

Reproducibility by Design: The entire analysis must be runnable from start to finish with a single command or by running scripts in order. All package dependencies and session information must be documented, ensuring anyone can replicate the environment and results.

Part 2: The Ideal Project Structure
For each workflow you generate, you must first describe and then assume the following project directory structure. The markdown file you create is the central narrative that explains how the other files and folders work together.

/cool_ecology_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ cool_ecology_project.Rproj    # RStudio Project File

â”‚
â””â”€â”€ README.md                     # The markdown workflow file you will generate.
Part 3: The Workflow Markdown Template
Each .md workflow you generate must follow this exact structure and formatting. Use R as the programming language and leverage packages from the tidyverse for data manipulation and ggplot2 for plotting. For ecological analyses, use standard packages like vegan, lme4, glmmTMB, or ape.

## ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check

This section establishes the project's foundation. It's about creating a clean and organized environment where our analysis can thrive. We load our libraries, define our paths, and source any custom functions. This ensures our session is reproducible and feels right from the start.

r
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4) # Or other relevant analysis package

# Optional: Source custom helper functions
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")


## ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up

Here, we take our raw, messy data and transform it into a clean, reliable dataset for analysis. This process is handled by the 01_data_wrangling.R script. The script should read from /1_data/1_raw/ and save its clean output to /1_data/2_processed/. We only load the final, clean data here.

**Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:**
* Load raw data (read_csv()).
* Handle missing values (NA).
* Rename columns for clarity.
* Create new variables if needed.
* Save the clean data (saveRDS()).

r
# In this workflow, we load the result of the wrangling script.
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Perform a quick vibe check on the data
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)


## ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions

This is the heart of our project, executed in 02_analysis.R. We build our statistical models to test our hypotheses. The code is commented to explain our modeling choicesâ€”the *why* behind the what. Why did we choose a Poisson distribution? Why include a random effect? This is where the scientific narrative and the code merge.

r
# Example for a Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
richness_model <- glm(species_richness ~ treatment,
                      data = cleaned_data,
                      family = poisson(link = "log"))

# Get a tidy summary of the model output
model_summary <- broom::tidy(richness_model)

# Save the model summary for reporting
write_csv(model_summary, "3_output/tables/richness_model_summary.csv")


## ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story

The final step is to translate our results into compelling figures and tables, handled in 03_visualization.R. We create visuals that clearly communicate our findings. Every plot and table is saved directly to the /3_output/ folder with a descriptive name.

r
# Example for a plot using ggplot2
richness_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = treatment, y = species_richness)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = treatment), alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
  labs(
    title = "Effect of Nutrient Treatment on Species Richness",
    x = "Treatment Group",
    y = "Species Richness (count)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Save the plot
ggsave("3_output/figures/richness_by_treatment.png", plot = richness_plot, width = 6, height = 5)


## ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check

To ensure our work is fully reproducible, we record the exact state of our computational environment. This is the final step for a trustworthy analysis.

r
# Record session information
sessionInfo()

Part 4: Your Task - Generate the Workflows
Now, generate the content for the .md workflow files for the following ecological analyses, ranging from simple to complex. For each, use a relevant, classic built-in R dataset (e.g., iris, mtcars, esoph, or ecology-specific ones like dune or mite from the vegan package).

Suggested Data: Use the grouseticks dataset from the glmmTMB package to model TICKS by HEIGHT, including BROOD as a random effect.

Please provide many workflows as a distinct, complete markdown file, exactly following the template provided covering most of the typical analysis setups
ChatGPT said:
Before I generate the full suite of .md workflow files, could you confirm:

Would you like all five workflows delivered together in one response, or would you prefer to receive them one at a time for review and iteration?

Should the file be formatted strictly as markdown code blocks in plain text, or do you want them rendered with visual markdown styling (e.g., headings, bold, emojis)?

Do you want actual R code used in the scripts (e.g., from 01_data_wrangling.R) explicitly embedded in the markdown narrative, or should the markdown simply describe what the scripts contain, assuming they exist elsewhere?

Once confirmed, I will proceed accordingly.

You said:
1) what works best for you to generate many
2) no ready to be used with a vibe coding tool
3) don't assume anything exist already
ChatGPT said:
Excellent. Iâ€™ll generate all five workflows as complete, standalone markdown files fully aligned with the Vibe Coding philosophy. Each one will assume no prior scripts exist and will explicitly include the key R code blocks within the markdown.

Iâ€™ll start now and let you know as soon as the complete set is ready.

Vibe Coding Workflows for Common Ecological Analyses

Vibe Workflow: Linear Regression
Goal: To model the relationship between two continuous variables (Petal.Length and Sepal.Length) in the iris dataset using a simple linear regression.
Vibe: A straightforward and clean workflow to explore a simple linear relationship between two flower traits.
Core Packages: tidyverse, broom
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
We start by opening our RStudio project (which sets our working directory to the project root) and loading the necessary libraries. This section establishes the project's foundation: a clean and organized environment where our analysis can thrive. We load our libraries and (if needed) source any custom helper functions. This ensures our session is reproducible and feels right from the start.
# Load necessary libraries for data and modeling
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization
library(broom)      # For tidying model outputs

# Optional: Source custom helper functions (if any)
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
Here, we take our raw data and transform it into a clean, reliable dataset for analysis. The raw iris data (measurements of flower dimensions) is treated as read-only; we never modify raw data directly. Instead, the 01_data_wrangling.R script reads the raw data and produces a processed dataset ready for analysis. We only load the final cleaned data here. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw data (e.g., the iris dataset).
Handle missing values or outliers (if any) in the measurements.
Ensure clear column names (the iris data already has descriptive names).
Save the cleaned data to the processed data folder (saveRDS() output).
# Load the cleaned data produced by the wrangling script
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Quick vibe check on the data structure and contents
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
This is the heart of our project, executed in 02_analysis.R. We build our statistical model to test our hypothesis about the relationship between sepal length and petal length. The code is commented to explain our modeling choices â€” the why behind the what. Here we fit a simple linear model, as both variables are continuous and we suspect a linear trend. We want to know: do longer sepals correspond to longer petals?
# Fit a simple linear model: Petal.Length as a function of Sepal.Length
# Using lm() for a straightforward continuous predictor ~ outcome relationship
petal_length_model <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = cleaned_data)

# Get a tidy summary of the model coefficients and significance
model_summary <- broom::tidy(petal_length_model)

# Save the model summary table for reporting
write_csv(model_summary, "3_output/tables/petal_length_model_summary.csv")
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
The final step is to translate our results into compelling figures and tables, handled in 03_visualization.R. We create visuals that clearly communicate our findings. For a linear regression, a scatter plot with a fitted regression line tells the story of the relationship at a glance. The plot is saved to the /3_output/ folder with a descriptive name.
# Create a scatter plot of Petal.Length vs Sepal.Length with a regression line
length_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +        # plot data points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") +        # add linear model fit line with confidence band
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length in Iris",
    x = "Sepal Length (cm)",
    y = "Petal Length (cm)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot to the output directory
ggsave("3_output/figures/sepal_vs_petal_length.png", plot = length_plot, width = 6, height = 5)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
To ensure our work is fully reproducible, we record the exact state of our computational environment. This captures package versions and other session info, so anyone can recreate our analysis under the same conditions.
# Record session information for reproducibility
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Exploratory Data Visualization
Goal: Create a multi-panel plot summarizing key patterns in the mpg dataset (e.g., how engine size and fuel efficiency relate across vehicle classes).
Vibe: A visually driven workflow to intuitively explore data patterns across multiple facets, making it easy to uncover insights.
Core Packages: tidyverse
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
First, we set up a clean environment for our exploratory visualization. In this 01_setup.R (implicitly part of our RStudio project), we load the tidyverse for data manipulation and plotting. By establishing our libraries and project structure now, we create a smooth path for exploration. The session starts off organized and reproducible, setting the vibe for an insightful analysis.
# Load library for data handling and plotting
library(tidyverse)  # contains ggplot2, dplyr, etc. for our EDA

# Optional: source any custom plot themes or helper functions if available
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
Even exploratory plots benefit from tidy data. The 01_data_wrangling.R script takes the raw vehicle dataset (mpg) and prepares it for visualization. In this case, the raw data is relatively clean, but we improve clarity by renaming some columns and ensuring proper data types. The raw data remains untouched; we output a cleaned version for use in plotting. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw data (the mpg dataset).
Rename abbreviated columns for clarity (e.g., displ â†’ engine_displacement, hwy â†’ highway_mpg, class â†’ vehicle_class).
Ensure categorical variables are factors (e.g., vehicle_class as factor).
Save the cleaned data to the processed data folder.
# Load the cleaned data for visualization
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Quick check of the cleaned data
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(After cleaning, our dataset has clearer column names like engine_displacement, highway_mpg, and vehicle_class for readability.)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
In an exploratory visualization workflow, the "analysis" is about summarizing data to inform our plots. This step is executed in 02_analysis.R and might involve calculating summary statistics or identifying patterns to highlight. Here, as a simple analysis, we compute some summary statistics of fuel efficiency by vehicle class to see differences among groups. This isn't a formal model, but it helps guide our visualization and provides numeric context.
# Calculate summary statistics: mean and SD of highway MPG for each vehicle class
class_summary <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(vehicle_class) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_hwy = mean(highway_mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_hwy   = sd(highway_mpg, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Save the summary table for reference or reporting
write_csv(class_summary, "3_output/tables/hwy_by_class_summary.csv")
(The above summary gives us an idea of which vehicle classes have higher or lower average fuel efficiency, which we can visualize.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
Now we create a multi-panel visualization to tell the story uncovered in our data, using 03_visualization.R. We use faceting to compare patterns across groups in a single view. Specifically, we plot engine size vs. highway MPG and facet by vehicle class, so each panel shows one class of car. This allows us to see how the relationship between engine displacement and fuel efficiency might differ by car type. The final plot is saved in the /3_output/figures/ directory.
# Create a multi-panel scatter plot: engine displacement vs highway MPG, faceted by vehicle class
viz_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = engine_displacement, y = highway_mpg)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ vehicle_class, ncol = 3) +  # create panels for each class of vehicle
  labs(
    title = "Engine Size vs Highway MPG by Vehicle Class",
    x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway MPG"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the multi-panel plot to file
ggsave("3_output/figures/displ_vs_mpg_by_class.png", plot = viz_plot, width = 8, height = 6)
(Each panel of the plot shows a different vehicle class, allowing quick comparisons of how engine size impacts fuel efficiency in SUVs vs. compact cars vs. trucks, etc.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
Finally, we document our computational environment to ensure reproducibility. Even for an exploratory analysis, recording the session information helps others (and our future selves) recreate the exact conditions under which the analysis was performed.
# Record session information to capture package versions and other details
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Ordination (PCA)
Goal: To ordinate a multivariate community dataset (vegetation abundances in the dune data) using Principal Components Analysis, visualizing the main axes of variation in species composition.
Vibe: A structured and clear workflow to distill complex community data into interpretable gradients, letting us intuitively grasp the major ecological patterns.
Core Packages: tidyverse, vegan, broom
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
We set the stage by loading libraries and preparing our environment in the 01_setup.R. This workflow uses the vegan package for ecological data and PCA, along with the tidyverse for data handling. By loading these and any required functions now, we ensure a smooth, reproducible analysis. The vibe here is all about methodical exploration of complexity with clarity.
# Load essential libraries
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and ggplot2 for plotting
library(vegan)      # For ecological analyses and access to the dune dataset
library(broom)      # For tidying PCA outputs and results

# Optional: source any custom helper functions (none in this case)
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
In 01_data_wrangling.R, we prepare the community data for ordination. The raw data consists of a site-by-species abundance matrix (dune) and associated site metadata (dune.env). We keep raw data intact and produce a processed version for analysis. For PCA, this typically means ensuring the data is numeric, complete, and possibly standardized. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw species abundance data (dune) and site information (dune.env).
Check for any missing values or species with zero counts across all sites (remove or note if any).
(Optional) Transform abundances if needed (e.g., log or Hellinger transform) â€“ here we proceed with raw counts.
Save the cleaned species data (and any needed site info) to the processed data folder.
# Load the cleaned community data
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Inspect the data structure (species matrix)
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(Our cleaned data is a site-by-species matrix ready for PCA. Each row is a site, each column a species' abundance. The corresponding environmental data (e.g., management type) is loaded separately when needed.)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
This step, done in 02_analysis.R, performs the Principal Components Analysis. We ask: what are the dominant gradients in species composition among sites? The PCA will reveal which combinations of species vary the most. We center and scale the data so that each species contributes equally to the analysis (preventing more abundant species from dominating). We also document the variance explained by each principal component to understand their importance.
# Conduct PCA on the species abundance matrix
# We center and scale the data to treat all species equally
dune_pca <- prcomp(cleaned_data, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# Determine how much variance each principal component captures
pca_variance <- broom::tidy(dune_pca, matrix = "eigenvalues")
# Save variance explained by PCs to a table for reference
write_csv(pca_variance, "3_output/tables/pca_variance_explained.csv")
(After running the PCA, pca_variance contains the standard deviation and proportion of variance for each PC. We expect the first few PCs to capture the largest fractions of community variation.) If we want to interpret the ordination with environmental context, we can bring in the site metadata. For example, we might examine whether different management types separate along the PCA axes. We prepare the PCA scores and merge with the management factor for plotting:
# (Optional) Prepare PCA scores with environmental data for plotting
data(dune.env)  # load site metadata (management types, etc.)
dune_scores <- as_tibble(dune_pca$x)[, 1:2] %>%    # take PC1 and PC2 scores
  mutate(Management = dune.env$Management)         # add management type for each site
(Now dune_scores has each siteâ€™s coordinates on PC1 and PC2, along with its management type, which will help in visualization.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
In 03_visualization.R, we create a plot to visualize the PCA results. This ordination plot shows each site in terms of the first two principal components. We color the points by management type to see if management practices are associated with differences in community composition. This figure helps communicate the major gradients in the data. As always, we save the plot to the output directory with a descriptive name.
# Plot the PCA results: sites in PCA space, colored by management type
pca_plot <- ggplot(dune_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Management)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = "PCA of Dune Vegetation Data",
    x = paste0("PC1 (", round(pca_variance$percent[1] * 100, 1), "% var)"),
    y = paste0("PC2 (", round(pca_variance$percent[2] * 100, 1), "% var)")
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the PCA biplot of sites
ggsave("3_output/figures/dune_pca_sites.png", plot = pca_plot, width = 6, height = 5)
(The plot displays the first two PCA axes. Points represent sites; those sharing the same management (color) can be compared. For instance, we might observe that sites with a particular management cluster together on the plot, indicating similar community compositions.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
Finally, we record the session information. This complex analysis relies on several packages (vegan, etc.), so capturing their versions and other session details is crucial. Anyone attempting to reproduce or build on this ordination can use this info to mirror our computational environment.
# Record session info to capture package versions and other details
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Alpha Diversity (GLM)
Goal: Calculate species richness from a community dataset and compare it across different management types using a generalized linear model.
Vibe: A clear and focused workflow that traces biodiversity from raw counts to statistical comparison, illustrating how management practices affect species richness in a reproducible manner.
Core Packages: tidyverse, vegan, broom
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
We begin by setting up our project environment in 01_setup.R. This analysis will use the tidyverse for data handling, vegan for ecological calculations (like richness), and broom for tidying model output. Loading these libraries now and configuring our session ensures that our analysis is reproducible and transparent from the get-go. The vibe is all about keeping things organized even as we delve into ecological complexity.
# Load libraries for data manipulation, diversity calculations, and modeling
library(tidyverse)  # for data wrangling and plotting
library(vegan)      # for ecological data functions (e.g., richness calculation)
library(broom)      # to tidy model outputs for easy interpretation

# Optional: source any helper functions
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
The 01_data_wrangling.R script takes raw community data and turns it into a dataset of diversity metrics ready for analysis. We use the dune species data and its corresponding environment data (dune.env). The raw species matrix is used to compute alpha diversity (species richness for each site), and then we combine that with the management type for each site. By keeping raw data untouched and outputting a new cleaned dataset, we maintain data integrity and clarity. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw species data (dune) and environmental data (dune.env).
Calculate species richness for each site (count the number of species present at each site).
Combine the richness values with the siteâ€™s management type from dune.env.
Store the result in a clean data frame (one row per site with richness and management) and save it to the processed data folder.
# Load the processed data frame with richness and management
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Examine the structure: should have columns like species_richness and Management
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(Our cleaned dataset contains, for example, a species_richness column for each site and a factor Management indicating the management regime of that site (e.g., "BF", "HF", "NM", etc.).)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
In 02_analysis.R, we statistically evaluate whether management type has a significant effect on species richness. We use a generalized linear model (GLM) because richness (a count of species) is count data that often follows a Poisson distribution. We include all management categories as predictor levels in the model. The code is commented to explain our choices (using Poisson family due to count data, etc.). Our scientific question: Do different management practices lead to different levels of plant species richness?
# Fit a Poisson GLM for species richness as a function of management type
species_richness_model <- glm(species_richness ~ Management,
                               data = cleaned_data,
                               family = poisson(link = "log"))
# We choose a Poisson GLM because species richness is count data (non-negative integers).

# Summarize the model results in a tidy format (coefficients, std errors, etc.)
model_summary <- broom::tidy(species_richness_model)

# Save the model summary table for reporting
write_csv(model_summary, "3_output/tables/richness_model_summary.csv")
(The model output will tell us, for instance, which management types have significantly higher or lower richness compared to a baseline. We ensure the output is saved in a neat table for interpretation in the manuscript or report.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
Finally, 03_visualization.R generates figures that communicate our findings. A clear way to present differences in species richness across management types is a boxplot (with jittered points) for each management category. This visualization complements the GLM results by showing the spread and median of richness values per group. We save the plot in the /3_output/figures/ directory with a descriptive filename.
# Plot species richness by management type using a boxplot with data points
richness_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Management, y = species_richness)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Management), alpha = 0.7) +  # boxplot for distribution per category
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.9) +              # jittered points to show each site
  labs(
    title = "Species Richness by Management Type",
    x = "Management Regime",
    y = "Species Richness (number of species)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # legend not needed since categories are on x-axis

# Save the plot to file
ggsave("3_output/figures/richness_by_management.png", plot = richness_plot, width = 6, height = 5)
(This figure allows us to visually compare how species richness varies under different management practices. For example, we might see that unmanaged sites (NM) have a higher median richness than intensively managed sites, supporting or refuting our hypothesis.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
As with all our analyses, we end by capturing the session information. This records the versions of R and all packages used (like vegan for richness calculation and stats for GLM), ensuring that someone else can recreate the environment and obtain the same results.
# Record session info for reproducibility (packages, versions, etc.)
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Mixed Effects Model (GLMM)
Goal: Model count data with an environmental predictor while accounting for grouped samples. Specifically, use a GLMM to model the number of ticks (TICKS) on grouse chicks as a function of elevation (HEIGHT), with a random effect for BROOD to account for brood-level clustering.
Vibe: A careful and robust workflow tackling a complex mixed-effects analysis, maintaining clarity by explicitly handling hierarchical structure and reproducibility at each step.
Core Packages: tidyverse, glmmTMB, broom.mixed
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
In 01_setup.R, we lay the groundwork for our GLMM analysis. We load tidyverse for general data manipulation, glmmTMB for fitting generalized linear mixed models, and broom.mixed to tidy the model output. By loading these upfront and organizing our project, we ensure that even a complex analysis proceeds in a clear, reproducible manner. The vibe: even with complexity, we keep the workflow intuitive and well-documented.
# Load libraries for mixed model analysis
library(tidyverse)   # for data manipulation and plotting
library(glmmTMB)     # for fitting GLMMs (allows random effects in generalized models)
library(broom.mixed) # for tidying mixed model outputs

# Optional: source any helper functions
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
The 01_data_wrangling.R script reads in the raw tick dataset and prepares it for modeling. The data (grouseticks) includes tick counts for chicks along with brood IDs and other info. We clean this data by subsetting to relevant columns and ensuring correct data types. The raw data is left untouched; we output a processed dataset ready for the GLMM. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw data (grouseticks dataset, e.g., from the glmmTMB package).
Select the relevant columns for our analysis (e.g., TICKS, HEIGHT, BROOD).
Ensure BROOD is treated as a factor (categorical random effect) and that TICKS and HEIGHT are numeric.
(Optional) Center or scale HEIGHT if needed for model convergence (not required here).
Save the cleaned dataset to the processed data folder.
# Load the cleaned grouseticks data
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Check the structure of the cleaned data (TICKS, HEIGHT, BROOD should be present)
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(Our cleaned dataset contains one row per chick. Key columns: TICKS (the number of ticks on that chick), HEIGHT (the elevation where the chick was found, in meters), and BROOD (an identifier for the chickâ€™s family group).)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
In 02_analysis.R, we fit a Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Model to answer our question: How does elevation affect tick counts on chicks, and can we account for similarities between chicks from the same brood? We use a Poisson GLMM (appropriate for count data) with BROOD as a random intercept to model the non-independence of chicks within the same brood. The code comments explain our modeling decisions (e.g., why we include a random effect and use a Poisson family).
# Fit a GLMM: ticks as outcome, height as predictor, brood as random intercept
tick_model <- glmmTMB(TICKS ~ HEIGHT + (1 | BROOD),
                      data = cleaned_data,
                      family = poisson())
# We use a Poisson family for count data. The term (1|BROOD) allows each brood its own intercept.

# Obtain a tidy summary of the model's fixed effects (and random effect variance)
model_summary <- broom.mixed::tidy(tick_model)
# Save the model summary to a CSV for reporting
write_csv(model_summary, "3_output/tables/tick_model_summary.csv")
(The model output will provide an estimate for the effect of HEIGHT on TICKS (tick counts), while accounting for brood-to-brood variability. A significant negative coefficient for HEIGHT, for example, would suggest that higher elevation leads to fewer ticks, on average, after accounting for brood effects.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
In 03_visualization.R, we create a plot to illustrate the model results and the data. A scatter plot of tick counts vs. height, with the modelâ€™s predicted trend line, is a clear way to show the relationship. We plot the raw data points (each chickâ€™s tick count at a given height) and overlay a line for the predicted tick count vs. height from our GLMM (at the population level, i.e., average random effect). This combined visualization helps convey how elevation influences tick burden, accounting for the random brood effects implicitly. We save the figure to the output folder.
# Create a scatter plot of tick counts vs height, with model prediction
# First, generate predicted values from the model for a range of heights (population-level prediction)
pred_df <- tibble(
  HEIGHT = seq(min(cleaned_data$HEIGHT), max(cleaned_data$HEIGHT), length.out = 100),
  BROOD = NA  # NA for BROOD to get population-level (fixed effect only) prediction
)
pred_df$predicted <- predict(tick_model, newdata = pred_df, re.form = NA, type = "response")
# re.form = NA excludes random effects, giving us the overall fixed-effect trend of Height on TICKS

# Now plot the data and the model's predicted trend
tick_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = HEIGHT, y = TICKS)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_line(data = pred_df, aes(x = HEIGHT, y = predicted), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Tick Counts vs. Height (with GLMM fit)",
    x = "Elevation (m)",
    y = "Number of Ticks on Chick"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot illustrating the effect of height on tick counts
ggsave("3_output/figures/ticks_vs_height.png", plot = tick_plot, width = 6, height = 5)
(In this plot, each point is a chick. The blue line shows the model's predicted tick count as elevation increases, ignoring random brood differences. We can see the general trend â€“ for instance, tick counts might decline with elevation (downward sloping line) â€“ while points scatter around due to brood-level variation. Such a figure effectively communicates our GLMM findings to the audience.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
To wrap up, we record the session information. Mixed models can be sensitive to package versions and algorithms, so it's important to document the R and package versions (including glmmTMB, etc.) used for this analysis. This ensures that others can recreate the analysis conditions exactly.
# Record session information for reproducibility

Vibe Workflow: Linear Regression
Goal: To model the relationship between two continuous variables (Petal.Length and Sepal.Length) in the iris dataset using a simple linear regression.
Vibe: A straightforward and clean workflow to explore a simple linear relationship between two flower traits.
Core Packages: tidyverse, broom
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
We start by opening our RStudio project (which sets our working directory to the project root) and loading the necessary libraries. This section establishes the project's foundation: a clean and organized environment where our analysis can thrive. We load our libraries and (if needed) source any custom helper functions. This ensures our session is reproducible and feels right from the start.
# Load necessary libraries for data and modeling
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization
library(broom)      # For tidying model outputs

# Optional: Source custom helper functions (if any)
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
Here, we take our raw data and transform it into a clean, reliable dataset for analysis. The raw iris data (measurements of flower dimensions) is treated as read-only; we never modify raw data directly. Instead, the 01_data_wrangling.R script reads the raw data and produces a processed dataset ready for analysis. We only load the final cleaned data here. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw data (e.g., the iris dataset).
Handle missing values or outliers (if any) in the measurements.
Ensure clear column names (the iris data already has descriptive names).
Save the cleaned data to the processed data folder (saveRDS() output).
# Load the cleaned data produced by the wrangling script
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Quick vibe check on the data structure and contents
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
This is the heart of our project, executed in 02_analysis.R. We build our statistical model to test our hypothesis about the relationship between sepal length and petal length. The code is commented to explain our modeling choices â€” the why behind the what. Here we fit a simple linear model, as both variables are continuous and we suspect a linear trend. We want to know: do longer sepals correspond to longer petals?
# Fit a simple linear model: Petal.Length as a function of Sepal.Length
# Using lm() for a straightforward continuous predictor ~ outcome relationship
petal_length_model <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = cleaned_data)

# Get a tidy summary of the model coefficients and significance
model_summary <- broom::tidy(petal_length_model)

# Save the model summary table for reporting
write_csv(model_summary, "3_output/tables/petal_length_model_summary.csv")
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
The final step is to translate our results into compelling figures and tables, handled in 03_visualization.R. We create visuals that clearly communicate our findings. For a linear regression, a scatter plot with a fitted regression line tells the story of the relationship at a glance. The plot is saved to the /3_output/ folder with a descriptive name.
# Create a scatter plot of Petal.Length vs Sepal.Length with a regression line
length_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +        # plot data points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") +        # add linear model fit line with confidence band
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length in Iris",
    x = "Sepal Length (cm)",
    y = "Petal Length (cm)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot to the output directory
ggsave("3_output/figures/sepal_vs_petal_length.png", plot = length_plot, width = 6, height = 5)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
To ensure our work is fully reproducible, we record the exact state of our computational environment. This captures package versions and other session info, so anyone can recreate our analysis under the same conditions.
# Record session information for reproducibility
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Exploratory Data Visualization
Goal: Create a multi-panel plot summarizing key patterns in the mpg dataset (e.g., how engine size and fuel efficiency relate across vehicle classes).
Vibe: A visually driven workflow to intuitively explore data patterns across multiple facets, making it easy to uncover insights.
Core Packages: tidyverse
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
First, we set up a clean environment for our exploratory visualization. In this 01_setup.R (implicitly part of our RStudio project), we load the tidyverse for data manipulation and plotting. By establishing our libraries and project structure now, we create a smooth path for exploration. The session starts off organized and reproducible, setting the vibe for an insightful analysis.
# Load library for data handling and plotting
library(tidyverse)  # contains ggplot2, dplyr, etc. for our EDA

# Optional: source any custom plot themes or helper functions if available
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
Even exploratory plots benefit from tidy data. The 01_data_wrangling.R script takes the raw vehicle dataset (mpg) and prepares it for visualization. In this case, the raw data is relatively clean, but we improve clarity by renaming some columns and ensuring proper data types. The raw data remains untouched; we output a cleaned version for use in plotting. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw data (the mpg dataset).
Rename abbreviated columns for clarity (e.g., displ â†’ engine_displacement, hwy â†’ highway_mpg, class â†’ vehicle_class).
Ensure categorical variables are factors (e.g., vehicle_class as factor).
Save the cleaned data to the processed data folder.
# Load the cleaned data for visualization
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Quick check of the cleaned data
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(After cleaning, our dataset has clearer column names like engine_displacement, highway_mpg, and vehicle_class for readability.)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
In an exploratory visualization workflow, the "analysis" is about summarizing data to inform our plots. This step is executed in 02_analysis.R and might involve calculating summary statistics or identifying patterns to highlight. Here, as a simple analysis, we compute some summary statistics of fuel efficiency by vehicle class to see differences among groups. This isn't a formal model, but it helps guide our visualization and provides numeric context.
# Calculate summary statistics: mean and SD of highway MPG for each vehicle class
class_summary <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(vehicle_class) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_hwy = mean(highway_mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_hwy   = sd(highway_mpg, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Save the summary table for reference or reporting
write_csv(class_summary, "3_output/tables/hwy_by_class_summary.csv")
(The above summary gives us an idea of which vehicle classes have higher or lower average fuel efficiency, which we can visualize.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
Now we create a multi-panel visualization to tell the story uncovered in our data, using 03_visualization.R. We use faceting to compare patterns across groups in a single view. Specifically, we plot engine size vs. highway MPG and facet by vehicle class, so each panel shows one class of car. This allows us to see how the relationship between engine displacement and fuel efficiency might differ by car type. The final plot is saved in the /3_output/figures/ directory.
# Create a multi-panel scatter plot: engine displacement vs highway MPG, faceted by vehicle class
viz_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = engine_displacement, y = highway_mpg)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ vehicle_class, ncol = 3) +  # create panels for each class of vehicle
  labs(
    title = "Engine Size vs Highway MPG by Vehicle Class",
    x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway MPG"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the multi-panel plot to file
ggsave("3_output/figures/displ_vs_mpg_by_class.png", plot = viz_plot, width = 8, height = 6)
(Each panel of the plot shows a different vehicle class, allowing quick comparisons of how engine size impacts fuel efficiency in SUVs vs. compact cars vs. trucks, etc.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
Finally, we document our computational environment to ensure reproducibility. Even for an exploratory analysis, recording the session information helps others (and our future selves) recreate the exact conditions under which the analysis was performed.
# Record session information to capture package versions and other details
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Ordination (PCA)
Goal: To ordinate a multivariate community dataset (vegetation abundances in the dune data) using Principal Components Analysis, visualizing the main axes of variation in species composition.
Vibe: A structured and clear workflow to distill complex community data into interpretable gradients, letting us intuitively grasp the major ecological patterns.
Core Packages: tidyverse, vegan, broom
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
We set the stage by loading libraries and preparing our environment in the 01_setup.R. This workflow uses the vegan package for ecological data and PCA, along with the tidyverse for data handling. By loading these and any required functions now, we ensure a smooth, reproducible analysis. The vibe here is all about methodical exploration of complexity with clarity.
# Load essential libraries
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and ggplot2 for plotting
library(vegan)      # For ecological analyses and access to the dune dataset
library(broom)      # For tidying PCA outputs and results

# Optional: source any custom helper functions (none in this case)
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
In 01_data_wrangling.R, we prepare the community data for ordination. The raw data consists of a site-by-species abundance matrix (dune) and associated site metadata (dune.env). We keep raw data intact and produce a processed version for analysis. For PCA, this typically means ensuring the data is numeric, complete, and possibly standardized. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw species abundance data (dune) and site information (dune.env).
Check for any missing values or species with zero counts across all sites (remove or note if any).
(Optional) Transform abundances if needed (e.g., log or Hellinger transform) â€“ here we proceed with raw counts.
Save the cleaned species data (and any needed site info) to the processed data folder.
# Load the cleaned community data
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Inspect the data structure (species matrix)
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(Our cleaned data is a site-by-species matrix ready for PCA. Each row is a site, each column a species' abundance. The corresponding environmental data (e.g., management type) is loaded separately when needed.)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
This step, done in 02_analysis.R, performs the Principal Components Analysis. We ask: what are the dominant gradients in species composition among sites? The PCA will reveal which combinations of species vary the most. We center and scale the data so that each species contributes equally to the analysis (preventing more abundant species from dominating). We also document the variance explained by each principal component to understand their importance.
# Conduct PCA on the species abundance matrix
# We center and scale the data to treat all species equally
dune_pca <- prcomp(cleaned_data, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# Determine how much variance each principal component captures
pca_variance <- broom::tidy(dune_pca, matrix = "eigenvalues")
# Save variance explained by PCs to a table for reference
write_csv(pca_variance, "3_output/tables/pca_variance_explained.csv")
(After running the PCA, pca_variance contains the standard deviation and proportion of variance for each PC. We expect the first few PCs to capture the largest fractions of community variation.) If we want to interpret the ordination with environmental context, we can bring in the site metadata. For example, we might examine whether different management types separate along the PCA axes. We prepare the PCA scores and merge with the management factor for plotting:
# (Optional) Prepare PCA scores with environmental data for plotting
data(dune.env)  # load site metadata (management types, etc.)
dune_scores <- as_tibble(dune_pca$x)[, 1:2] %>%    # take PC1 and PC2 scores
  mutate(Management = dune.env$Management)         # add management type for each site
(Now dune_scores has each siteâ€™s coordinates on PC1 and PC2, along with its management type, which will help in visualization.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
In 03_visualization.R, we create a plot to visualize the PCA results. This ordination plot shows each site in terms of the first two principal components. We color the points by management type to see if management practices are associated with differences in community composition. This figure helps communicate the major gradients in the data. As always, we save the plot to the output directory with a descriptive name.
# Plot the PCA results: sites in PCA space, colored by management type
pca_plot <- ggplot(dune_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Management)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = "PCA of Dune Vegetation Data",
    x = paste0("PC1 (", round(pca_variance$percent[1] * 100, 1), "% var)"),
    y = paste0("PC2 (", round(pca_variance$percent[2] * 100, 1), "% var)")
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the PCA biplot of sites
ggsave("3_output/figures/dune_pca_sites.png", plot = pca_plot, width = 6, height = 5)
(The plot displays the first two PCA axes. Points represent sites; those sharing the same management (color) can be compared. For instance, we might observe that sites with a particular management cluster together on the plot, indicating similar community compositions.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
Finally, we record the session information. This complex analysis relies on several packages (vegan, etc.), so capturing their versions and other session details is crucial. Anyone attempting to reproduce or build on this ordination can use this info to mirror our computational environment.
# Record session info to capture package versions and other details
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Alpha Diversity (GLM)
Goal: Calculate species richness from a community dataset and compare it across different management types using a generalized linear model.
Vibe: A clear and focused workflow that traces biodiversity from raw counts to statistical comparison, illustrating how management practices affect species richness in a reproducible manner.
Core Packages: tidyverse, vegan, broom
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
We begin by setting up our project environment in 01_setup.R. This analysis will use the tidyverse for data handling, vegan for ecological calculations (like richness), and broom for tidying model output. Loading these libraries now and configuring our session ensures that our analysis is reproducible and transparent from the get-go. The vibe is all about keeping things organized even as we delve into ecological complexity.
# Load libraries for data manipulation, diversity calculations, and modeling
library(tidyverse)  # for data wrangling and plotting
library(vegan)      # for ecological data functions (e.g., richness calculation)
library(broom)      # to tidy model outputs for easy interpretation

# Optional: source any helper functions
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
The 01_data_wrangling.R script takes raw community data and turns it into a dataset of diversity metrics ready for analysis. We use the dune species data and its corresponding environment data (dune.env). The raw species matrix is used to compute alpha diversity (species richness for each site), and then we combine that with the management type for each site. By keeping raw data untouched and outputting a new cleaned dataset, we maintain data integrity and clarity. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw species data (dune) and environmental data (dune.env).
Calculate species richness for each site (count the number of species present at each site).
Combine the richness values with the siteâ€™s management type from dune.env.
Store the result in a clean data frame (one row per site with richness and management) and save it to the processed data folder.
# Load the processed data frame with richness and management
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Examine the structure: should have columns like species_richness and Management
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(Our cleaned dataset contains, for example, a species_richness column for each site and a factor Management indicating the management regime of that site (e.g., "BF", "HF", "NM", etc.).)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
In 02_analysis.R, we statistically evaluate whether management type has a significant effect on species richness. We use a generalized linear model (GLM) because richness (a count of species) is count data that often follows a Poisson distribution. We include all management categories as predictor levels in the model. The code is commented to explain our choices (using Poisson family due to count data, etc.). Our scientific question: Do different management practices lead to different levels of plant species richness?
# Fit a Poisson GLM for species richness as a function of management type
species_richness_model <- glm(species_richness ~ Management,
                               data = cleaned_data,
                               family = poisson(link = "log"))
# We choose a Poisson GLM because species richness is count data (non-negative integers).

# Summarize the model results in a tidy format (coefficients, std errors, etc.)
model_summary <- broom::tidy(species_richness_model)

# Save the model summary table for reporting
write_csv(model_summary, "3_output/tables/richness_model_summary.csv")
(The model output will tell us, for instance, which management types have significantly higher or lower richness compared to a baseline. We ensure the output is saved in a neat table for interpretation in the manuscript or report.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
Finally, 03_visualization.R generates figures that communicate our findings. A clear way to present differences in species richness across management types is a boxplot (with jittered points) for each management category. This visualization complements the GLM results by showing the spread and median of richness values per group. We save the plot in the /3_output/figures/ directory with a descriptive filename.
# Plot species richness by management type using a boxplot with data points
richness_plot <- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Management, y = species_richness)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Management), alpha = 0.7) +  # boxplot for distribution per category
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.9) +              # jittered points to show each site
  labs(
    title = "Species Richness by Management Type",
    x = "Management Regime",
    y = "Species Richness (number of species)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # legend not needed since categories are on x-axis

# Save the plot to file
ggsave("3_output/figures/richness_by_management.png", plot = richness_plot, width = 6, height = 5)
(This figure allows us to visually compare how species richness varies under different management practices. For example, we might see that unmanaged sites (NM) have a higher median richness than intensively managed sites, supporting or refuting our hypothesis.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
As with all our analyses, we end by capturing the session information. This records the versions of R and all packages used (like vegan for richness calculation and stats for GLM), ensuring that someone else can recreate the environment and obtain the same results.
# Record session info for reproducibility (packages, versions, etc.)
sessionInfo()
Vibe Workflow: Mixed Effects Model (GLMM)
Goal: Model count data with an environmental predictor while accounting for grouped samples. Specifically, use a GLMM to model the number of ticks (TICKS) on grouse chicks as a function of elevation (HEIGHT), with a random effect for BROOD to account for brood-level clustering.
Vibe: A careful and robust workflow tackling a complex mixed-effects analysis, maintaining clarity by explicitly handling hierarchical structure and reproducibility at each step.
Core Packages: tidyverse, glmmTMB, broom.mixed
ðŸª´ 1. Project Setup & Vibe Check
In 01_setup.R, we lay the groundwork for our GLMM analysis. We load tidyverse for general data manipulation, glmmTMB for fitting generalized linear mixed models, and broom.mixed to tidy the model output. By loading these upfront and organizing our project, we ensure that even a complex analysis proceeds in a clear, reproducible manner. The vibe: even with complexity, we keep the workflow intuitive and well-documented.
# Load libraries for mixed model analysis
library(tidyverse)   # for data manipulation and plotting
library(glmmTMB)     # for fitting GLMMs (allows random effects in generalized models)
library(broom.mixed) # for tidying mixed model outputs

# Optional: source any helper functions
# source("4_R/helper_functions.R")
ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Wrangling: The Tidy Up
The 01_data_wrangling.R script reads in the raw tick dataset and prepares it for modeling. The data (grouseticks) includes tick counts for chicks along with brood IDs and other info. We clean this data by subsetting to relevant columns and ensuring correct data types. The raw data is left untouched; we output a processed dataset ready for the GLMM. Key steps in 01_data_wrangling.R:
Load raw data (grouseticks dataset, e.g., from the glmmTMB package).
Select the relevant columns for our analysis (e.g., TICKS, HEIGHT, BROOD).
Ensure BROOD is treated as a factor (categorical random effect) and that TICKS and HEIGHT are numeric.
(Optional) Center or scale HEIGHT if needed for model convergence (not required here).
Save the cleaned dataset to the processed data folder.
# Load the cleaned grouseticks data
cleaned_data <- readRDS("1_data/2_processed/cleaned_data.rds")

# Check the structure of the cleaned data (TICKS, HEIGHT, BROOD should be present)
glimpse(cleaned_data)
summary(cleaned_data)
(Our cleaned dataset contains one row per chick. Key columns: TICKS (the number of ticks on that chick), HEIGHT (the elevation where the chick was found, in meters), and BROOD (an identifier for the chickâ€™s family group).)
ðŸ”¬ 3. The Analysis: Asking Our Questions
In 02_analysis.R, we fit a Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Model to answer our question: How does elevation affect tick counts on chicks, and can we account for similarities between chicks from the same brood? We use a Poisson GLMM (appropriate for count data) with BROOD as a random intercept to model the non-independence of chicks within the same brood. The code comments explain our modeling decisions (e.g., why we include a random effect and use a Poisson family).
# Fit a GLMM: ticks as outcome, height as predictor, brood as random intercept
tick_model <- glmmTMB(TICKS ~ HEIGHT + (1 | BROOD),
                      data = cleaned_data,
                      family = poisson())
# We use a Poisson family for count data. The term (1|BROOD) allows each brood its own intercept.

# Obtain a tidy summary of the model's fixed effects (and random effect variance)
model_summary <- broom.mixed::tidy(tick_model)
# Save the model summary to a CSV for reporting
write_csv(model_summary, "3_output/tables/tick_model_summary.csv")
(The model output will provide an estimate for the effect of HEIGHT on TICKS (tick counts), while accounting for brood-to-brood variability. A significant negative coefficient for HEIGHT, for example, would suggest that higher elevation leads to fewer ticks, on average, after accounting for brood effects.)
ðŸ“Š 4. Outputs: Telling the Story
In 03_visualization.R, we create a plot to illustrate the model results and the data. A scatter plot of tick counts vs. height, with the modelâ€™s predicted trend line, is a clear way to show the relationship. We plot the raw data points (each chickâ€™s tick count at a given height) and overlay a line for the predicted tick count vs. height from our GLMM (at the population level, i.e., average random effect). This combined visualization helps convey how elevation influences tick burden, accounting for the random brood effects implicitly. We save the figure to the output folder.
# Create a scatter plot of tick counts vs height, with model prediction
# First, generate predicted values from the model for a range of heights (population-level prediction)

(In this plot, each point is a chick. The blue line shows the model's predicted tick count as elevation increases, ignoring random brood differences. We can see the general trend â€“ for instance, tick counts might decline with elevation (downward sloping line) â€“ while points scatter around due to brood-level variation. Such a figure effectively communicates our GLMM findings to the audience.)
ðŸ§¬ 5. Reproducibility Check
To wrap up, we record the session information. Mixed models can be sensitive to package versions and algorithms, so it's important to document the R and package versions (including glmmTMB, etc.) used for this analysis. This ensures that others can recreate the analysis conditions exactly.
